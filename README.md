# Module-5-Challenge

## Description

Third-Party APIs Challenge, or Module 5's Challenge, is to build a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am-5pm). This app will run in the browser and will feature HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The task will be achieved when an employee can add important events to a daily planner that will display the current day at the top of the calendar, present timeblocks for 9am-5pm, have those timeblock color coordinated by the current time (past,present,future), and also allow for an event to be saved to local storageand remain on the page after a refresh. This challenge will test our ability to understand Javascript and utilize jQuery, Day.js, if/else functions and dynamic CSS.
